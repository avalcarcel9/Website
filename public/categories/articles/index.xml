      <description>I am motivated by current scientific questions to develop general, principled methods for the analysis of data arising from neuroimaging studies. My work balances ideas from classification using machine learning and novel feature exploration in order to develop data analysis tools required to solve problems in structural imaging data sets in a clinically meaningful manner. Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in developing statistical methods for multi-modal analysis to better characterize and understand neurodevelopment.</description>

      <description>MIMoSA 
The R package mimosa is now live on Neuroconductor with the development version on GitHub. This package allows you to implement the MIMoSA method discussed in our original paper and follow up paper to automatically segment both T2 hyperintense lesions and T1 hypointense lesions. The package comes with some pre-trained models if you do not have manual segmentations to train the model. If you do have manual segmentations, we suggest you train the model with your data.</description>
