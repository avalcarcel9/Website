      <description>Introduction I’ve decided to dedicate the next few blog posts to using the Penn Medicine Academic Computing Services High-Performance Computing Cluster. I’ll loosely refer to the Penn HPC simply as the cluster, the CCEB cluster, the PMACs HPC, and the Penn HPC throughout this series of blog posts. These posts are intended for both beginners and advanced users and will include information about:
Basics in command line Definitions and vocabulary Logging onto the cluster PMACS high performance computing (HPC) grid specifications Session types Parallelizing code Quality controlling your jobs Bash aliases  This series is designed by a student for students specifically in biostatistics.</description>

      <description>In this post, I am going to cover the basics to creating a website using blogdown and Hugo. We will create and deploy a template website as well as cover some basics about changing content. You should be extremely comfortable coding in R, writing in R Markdown, and have a working knowledge of GitHub. You should have R, R Studio, R Markdown all installed on your computer and an account on GitHub before we start.</description>
