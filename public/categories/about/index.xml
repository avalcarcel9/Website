      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently a fifth-year doctoral student studying Biostatistics in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics at the University of Pennsylvania. I am an active researcher within the PennSIVE Center under the co-mentorship of Russell [Taki] Shinohara and Kristin Linn.
Primarily, my research interests lie in the development of statistical methods for analyzing neuroimaging data sets with the goal of understanding disease processes in the brain. Currently, my projects involve the analysis of multi-sequence structural MRI to study neurodevelopment and multiple sclerosis.</description>
