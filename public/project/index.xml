      <description>Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory disease of the brain and spinal cord characterized by demyelinating white matter referred to as white matter lesions. The number and volume of lesions are essential for evaluating disease-modifying therapies and monitoring disease activity. The current gold standard approach for lesion classification is the manual segmentation by a radiologist or other imaging scientist. Unfortunately, these methods are prone to a large amount of intra- and inter- observer variability.</description>
