When Hooli acquired Endframe, no one could wait to see what the tech giant would do with the revolutionary, middle-out compression technology. The wait is over: In a savvy pivot, Hooli took the software and created their newest hardware: the Hooli/Endframe Box. While initially conceived as a consumer-facing platform, the Endframe technology has been repurposed to “make the world a better place through secure, high-capacity enterprise data storage servers utilizing middle-out compression technology.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently a third-year PhD student in Biostatistics in the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics at the University of Pennsylvania. I am an active researcher in the PennSIVE working group under the mentorship of Russell [Taki] Shinohara. Primarily, my research interests lie in the development of statistical methods for analyzing neuroimaging data sets with the goal of understanding disease processes in the brain. Currently, my projects involve the analysis of multi-sequence structural MRI for the study of multiple sclerosis.</description>

      <description>I am motivated by current scientific questions to develop general, principled methods for the analysis of data arising from neuroimaging studies. My work balances ideas from machine learning algorithms and feature extraction development in order to develop data analysis tools required to solve problems in structural imaging data sets in a clinically meaningful manner. Specifically, I am interested in developing statistical methods to advance automated lesion detection in multiple sclerosis.</description>

      <description>MIMoSA 
The mimosa R package is now live on Neuroconductor. This package allows you to implement the MIMoSA method discussed in our paper to automatically segment white matter lesions. The package comes with some pre-trained models if you do not have manual segmentations to train the model. If you do have manual segmentations, we suggest you train the model with your data. You can access the page directly here.</description>

Gavin Belson’s name has long been synonymous with innovation—but beyond his work at Hooli, do we even know the man behind the rampant success? In a Code/Rag exclusive, Belson revealed to us 10 things about himself that aren’t common knowledge.
 He’s a nature fanatic! “It’s important to me that Hooli has an effective recycling program, and a personal passion of mine is donating to elephant sanctuaries.</description>

Gavin Belson’s brilliant leadership is unstoppable. While allegedly taking a personal hiatus from day-to-day operations at Hooli, Belson couldn’t resist brokering a blockbuster deal between Hooli and Maleant Data Systems, deploying Hooli’s innovative new Hooli/Endframe Box. The multi-year deal brings handsome margins for Hooli and can easily be a template to apply across the entire Fortune 1000. An inside source tells me that, no surprise, the board was no longer satisfied to let Belson fade into the background.</description>
