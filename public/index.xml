      <description>WARNING: This post contains spoilers for Game of Thrones and some foul language reproduced from the show script
April may as well be Game of Thrones (GoT) month. For 7 loyal years, fans eagerly await April as the premiere of the new season. The final season is no different and will yet again return in April…2019 bypassing a season in 2018.
  As a loyal fan I’m determined to not let my April 2018 be any different and am dedicating a few blog posts to GoT.</description>

      <description>In this post, I am going to cover the basics to creating a website using blogdown and Hugo. We will create and deploy a template website as well as cover some basics about changing content. You should be extremely comfortable coding in R, writing in R Markdown, and have a working knowledge of GitHub. You should have R, R Studio, R Markdown all installed on your computer and an account on GitHub before we start.</description>

      <description>I am motivated by current scientific questions to develop general, principled methods for the analysis of data arising from neuroimaging studies. My work balances ideas from machine learning algorithms and feature extraction development in order to develop data analysis tools required to solve problems in structural imaging data sets in a clinically meaningful manner. Specifically, I am interested in developing statistical methods to advance automated lesion detection in multiple sclerosis.</description>

      <description>MIMoSA 
The mimosa R package is now live on Neuroconductor with the development version on GitHub. This package allows you to implement the MIMoSA method discussed in our original paper and follow up paper to automatically segment white matter both T2 hyperintense lesions and T1 hypointense lesions. The package comes with some pre-trained models if you do not have manual segmentations to train the model. If you do have manual segmentations, we suggest you train the model with your data.</description>

      <description>Warning: This post contains spoilers for Game of Thrones seasons 1-7.
Like 16.5+ million people across the globe, I anxiously await the return of the eighth and final season of Game of Thrones (GoT) on April, 14, 2019. After a two year hiatus, I wanted to refresh my memory on the plot lines across seasons 1 through 7 before HBO wraps up the conflict.
In preparation, I decided to evaluate the statistical networks between characters across seasons 1 through 7 to consider how the network of characters has changed over time.</description>
