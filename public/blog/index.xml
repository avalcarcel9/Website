      <description>While the end of summer doesn’t always guarantee cooler weather it does always mean the start of a fresh and new school year.
   via GIPHY  I’ve been enrolled in full time school of some sort for 23 straight years now including pre-k and grad school. As a fifth year PhD student, I’m starting to get nostalgic that this is likely (and hopefully) my last year in school.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is the eighth blog post in a series of articles about using the CCEB cluster. An overview of the series is available here. This post focuses on normal sessions and submitting batch jobs.
Initializing a normal session and submitting a batch job is an advanced topic but you’ll still be requesting appropriate system parameters using the LSF bsub command. We will again focus on the bsub for a normal session and common advanced options associated with the bsub to request more cores for parallelization, force memory constraints on your session, and request certain machines.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is the sixth blog post in a series of articles about using the CCEB cluster. An overview of the series is available here. This post focuses on the basics of using an interactive session.
Interactive sessions are opened by requesting appropriate system parameters using the LSF bsub command. Once a session is open you can run your code on the loaded host interactively. This allows you to work dynamically on your code.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is the fifth blog post in a series of articles about using the CCEB cluster. An overview of the series is available here. This post focuses on the types of sessions available on the Penn HPC and when to use the different types.
There are two types of sessions you can request when working on the cluster. An interactive session or a normal session. I will discuss each in more detail below and in future posts.</description>

      <description>Introduction I’ve decided to dedicate the next few blog posts to using the Penn Medicine Academic Computing Services High-Performance Computing Cluster. I’ll loosely refer to the Penn HPC simply as the cluster, the CCEB cluster, the PMACs HPC, and the Penn HPC throughout this series of blog posts. These posts are intended for both beginners and advanced users and will include information about:
Basics in command line Definitions and vocabulary Logging onto the cluster PMACS high performance computing (HPC) grid specifications Session types Parallelizing code in interactive and normal sessions Quality controlling your jobs Bash aliases  This series is designed by a student for students specifically in biostatistics.</description>

      <description>Warning: This post contains spoilers for Game of Thrones seasons 1-7.
Like 16.5+ million people across the globe, I anxiously await the return of the eighth and final season of Game of Thrones (GoT) on April, 14, 2019. After a two year hiatus, I wanted to refresh my memory on the plot lines across seasons 1 through 7 before HBO wraps up the conflict.
In preparation, I decided to evaluate the statistical networks between characters across seasons 1 through 7 to consider how the network of characters has changed over time.</description>

      <description>WARNING: This post contains spoilers for Game of Thrones and some foul language reproduced from the show script
April may as well be Game of Thrones (GoT) month. For 7 loyal years, fans eagerly await April as the premiere of the new season. The final season is no different and will yet again return in April…2019 bypassing a season in 2018.
  As a loyal fan I’m determined to not let my April 2018 be any different and am dedicating a few blog posts to GoT.</description>

      <description>In this post, I am going to cover the basics to creating a website using blogdown and Hugo. We will create and deploy a template website as well as cover some basics about changing content. You should be extremely comfortable coding in R, writing in R Markdown, and have a working knowledge of GitHub. You should have R, R Studio, R Markdown all installed on your computer and an account on GitHub before we start.</description>
