<p><strong>WARNING: This post contains spoilers for Game of Thrones and some foul language reproduced from the show script</strong></p>
<p>April may as well be Game of Thrones (GoT) month. For 7 loyal years, fans eagerly await April as the premiere of the new season. The final season is no different and will yet again return in April…2019 bypassing a season in 2018.</p>

<p>As a loyal fan I’m determined to not let my April 2018 be any different and am dedicating a few blog posts to GoT. The project will involve some analysis of GoT data available on the internet such as scripts, HBO main characters lists, and some other character lists. In this specific post, I will not cover the basics of scraping but rather provide some resources to scrape the material. I’ll be using the data obtained using this code in future blog posts and wanted to provide a way for any user to reproduce my analysis. Up until a few weeks ago, I myself didn’t know what web scraping was so if you weren’t aware web scraping it is simply extracting data from websites. Essentially, I can pull the html source code used to generate and host the website and then harvest or extract the information to be used as data. All the data scraping and analysis will be done in the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R environment</a>.</p>
<p>Shall we begin?</p>
<center>
<img HEIGHT="350" src="/img/got_package/shallwebegin.png" alt="Late Season Meme">
</center>
<p>All of the code provided below uses the filepaths specific to my computer. To reproduce just be sure to change these filepaths to match that of your computer and where you’ll be saving and loading data. Use the button below to download code to scrape and clean all the data I will be using. Code provided in the download is more thorough than that used in the tutorial.</p>

<div id="scraping-got-scripts" class="section level2">
<h2>Scraping GoT Scripts</h2>
<p>I want to eventually do some analysis on the GoT scripts. Since HBO does not provide these scripts, I’m going to rely on <a href="www.genius.com">www.genius.com</a>. I chose this website for two main reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>An R package <code>geniusr</code> already exists with functions to easily scrape the data</li>
<li>These scripts contain the speaker information which I’ll need later for my eventual analysis</li>
</ol>
<p>To use the <code>geniusr</code> package you must have an API token. Go <a href="https://genius.com/signup_or_login">here</a> to create an account or login and obtain an API token. For more information on the API creation you can look at the genius documentation <a href="https://docs.genius.com/#/getting-started-h1">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once you’ve created an account and obtained an API they’ll assign you a token. Be sure to copy the token. With the token copied you can add it to the R environment with some code.</p>
<p>Running the following code will open your .Renviron</p>
<pre class="r"><code>user_renviron = path.expand(file.path(&quot;~&quot;, &quot;.Renviron&quot;))
if(!file.exists(user_renviron)) # check to see if the file already exists
  file.create(user_renviron)
file.edit(user_renviron) # open with another text editor if this fails</code></pre>
<p>Once this file is open paste the following into the script:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>GENIUS_API_TOKEN=&quot;your-token-goes-here&quot;</code></pre>
<p>If done properly then this code will return your API token.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Sys.getenv(&quot;GENIUS_API_TOKEN&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now you can install and load <code>geniusr</code> to scrape some data. You can find more information about the <code>geniusr</code> package through <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geniusr/index.html">CRAN</a> or the package maintainers <a href="https://github.com/ewenme/geniusr">GitHub</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Install the stable version from CRAN
install.packages(&#39;geniusr&#39;)
# Install the developers version from GitHub directly
devtools::install_github(&#39;ewenme/geniusr&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Recently, I’ve had Amy Winehouse’s Back to Black album on repeat so to show a simple example I’ll use this artist and album to show a quick demo of a few <code>geniusr</code> functions. If you want to explore the website I will be scraping here you can start <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Amy-winehouse/">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Warning: Before running any of the functions below be aware that you are pinging the genius server every time you request data. If done quickly or too often it can trigger the server to set up security measures and block your IP from using the site. It is always best to ping the server once and then save the data so that you don’t have to constantly be pulling the data.</em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(geniusr)
# Search for Amy Winehouse
geniusr::search_artist(&quot;Amy Winehouse&quot;)
# Use artist_id to obtain song_id
geniusr::get_artist_songs(artist_id = 1525)
# Scrape lyrics using an ID
geniusr::scrape_lyrics_id(song_id = 247618)
# Get song lyrics to Rehab using the URL directly
geniusr::scrape_lyrics_url(&quot;https://genius.com/Amy-winehouse-rehab-lyrics&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Genius was originally set up to host lyrics of songs as well as artist and album information. Now they host TV show and movie scripts as well. The GoT scripts can be accessed <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Game-of-thrones">here</a>. Notice, the seasons are recorded as an “album” on the site and within each album the script for an episode is characterized as a song. To scrape Game of Thrones data, I created an R package that wraps <code>geniusr</code> or does the scraping within the function. You can find out more about the package on my <a href="https://github.com/avalcarcel9/GoT">GitHub</a>. To download the development version from my GitHub run:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::install_github(&quot;avalcarcel9/GoT&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>library(GoT)</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s scrape the scripts and then save them so you don’t need to continuously ping the genius server. Be sure to change the directory in <code>save()</code> when you run this code.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Obtain all the scripts
geniusr_scripts = scrape_GoT(base_url = &quot;https://genius.com/albums/Game-of-thrones&quot;, season = 7)

# Visualize the data
head(geniusr_scripts)
tail(geniusr_scripts)

# Save data - Change filepath to match where you&#39;d like to save the data
save(geniusr_scripts, file = &quot;/Users/alval/Box/Coursework/IndStudy/Data/geniusr_scripts.RData&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>Again, I scrape the website once and save the results as an R object so I do not get blocked for scraping too much from genius. After I’ve saved the file then whenever I want to start working with the data I simply load my scraped file rather than re-scrape from the internet.</p>
<p>We now have every episode script with season indicators!</p>
<p>The <code>GoT</code> package also comes with a simple function to clean the <a href="www.genius.com">www.genius.com</a> scripts. It extracts the speaker information, tries to clean the speaking character name, adds actions in a column if indicated, and removes some of the narration.</p>

<div id="scrape-episode-lengths" class="section level2">
<h2>Scrape Episode Lengths</h2>
<p>To add temporal information to the season and episode, I need each episode length. This scraping process will be very similar to the scripts above. We will use an R package <code>omdbapi</code> which is borrowing information from IMDB. Similar to <code>geniusr</code> you need to create an account at <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/">http://www.omdbapi.com/</a>. After creating an account you can obtain and API token. Follow the steps in <strong>Scraping GoT Scripts</strong> section and put the API token in your .Renviron as <code>OMDB_API_KEY="your_key_goes_here"</code>. Be sure to activate this key or the <code>omdbapi</code> package won’t work.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Install omdbapi
devtools::install_github(&quot;hrbrmstr/omdbapi&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The package developer has a lot of documentation on their GitHub <a href="https://github.com/hrbrmstr/omdbapi">https://github.com/hrbrmstr/omdbapi</a> if you’d like to explore the package more. Conveniently, they have an example that obtains specific Game of Thrones data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(omdbapi)
library(dplyr)

# Example from github
imdb_data = omdbapi::find_by_title(&quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, type=&quot;series&quot;, season=1, episode=1)

# Remove first row to create an empty tibble
imdb_data = imdb_data %&gt;% 
  dplyr::slice(-1)

# Get each episode
# Seaon 1
for(i in 1:10){
  imdb_data = dplyr::bind_rows(imdb_data, omdbapi::find_by_title(&quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, type=&quot;series&quot;, season=1, episode=i))
  Sys.sleep(90)
}
Sys.sleep(120)
# Season 2
for(i in 1:10){
  imdb_data = dplyr::bind_rows(imdb_data, omdbapi::find_by_title(&quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, type=&quot;series&quot;, season=2, episode=i))
  Sys.sleep(90)
}
Sys.sleep(120)
# Season 3
for(i in 1:10){
  imdb_data = dplyr::bind_rows(imdb_data, omdbapi::find_by_title(&quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, type=&quot;series&quot;, season=3, episode=i))
  Sys.sleep(90)
}
Sys.sleep(120)
# Season 4
for(i in 1:10){
  imdb_data = dplyr::bind_rows(imdb_data, omdbapi::find_by_title(&quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, type=&quot;series&quot;, season=4, episode=i))
  Sys.sleep(90)
}
Sys.sleep(120)
# Season 5
for(i in 1:10){
  imdb_data = dplyr::bind_rows(imdb_data, omdbapi::find_by_title(&quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, type=&quot;series&quot;, season=5, episode=i))
  Sys.sleep(90)
}
Sys.sleep(120)
# Season 6
for(i in 1:10){
  imdb_data = dplyr::bind_rows(imdb_data, omdbapi::find_by_title(&quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, type=&quot;series&quot;, season=6, episode=i))
  Sys.sleep(90)
}
Sys.sleep(120)
# Season 7
for(i in 1:7){
  imdb_data = dplyr::bind_rows(imdb_data, omdbapi::find_by_title(&quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, type=&quot;series&quot;, season=7, episode=i))
  Sys.sleep(90)
}

save(imdb_data, file = &#39;Users/alval/Box/Coursework/IndStudy/Data/imdb_data.RData&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Normally, I would create a nested for loop but the <code>omdbapi</code> package gives errors when data is scraped too quickly so instead I just created individual for loops for each season and waited a minute before running each one.</p>
<p>This returns a lot of data from IMDB. While I only need the episode length (<code>runtime</code>) I’m not going to remove any column as it may be interesting to use some of this data later.</p>
</div>
<div id="scrape-character-names" class="section level2">
<h2>Scrape Character Names</h2>
<p>To scrape the character names I used <a href="%22http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/List_of_characters%22">“http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/List_of_characters”</a>. This website contains all characters in GoT (book and show). The character list will be used as a reference for data cleaning which is to come in future blog posts.</p>
<p>I created a scraping function to pull the characters from the website and clean the data into a tibble. I’ll save the character vector so scraping only has to be done once. This list includes over 2000 characters. Many of these characters on this website contain the same first names. This is going to make data cleaning later more difficult. Due to this, we will additionally scrape <a href="https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew">HBO’s</a> main character list. I created two functions in the <code>GoT</code> package to help us do this <code>GoT::scrape_characters</code> and <code>GoT::scrape_HBO_characters</code> which both scrape each respective website for the character list.</p>
<p>Now we can apply these functions to scrape and save the character data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Scrape wiki characters and save
url = &quot;http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/List_of_characters&quot;

<p>The <code>wiki_characters</code> contains a lot of information about character names, nicknames, and even description and will be useful later as a reference. The <code>hbo_characters</code> object contains information only pertaining to the main characters on the show. I’ll be using this information later to clean the script data.</p>

<h2>Scrape Character Death Timeline</h2>
<p>To scrape the character deaths and at what time in a particular season and episode they die I use the website <a href="%22https://deathtimeline.com/%22">“https://deathtimeline.com/”</a>. This website contains dynamic content that allows the user to interact with and needs some extra TLC to scrape.</p>
<p>From this, I obtain who is killed, how they were killed, the time they were killed, season, episode, and specifically how they were killed. The specific kill is to describe who killed that person. There is some bias to this data. Mostly the bias is that it is taken from <a href="https://deathtimeline.com/">https://deathtimeline.com/</a> and relies on their information. From that data I can only collect that they deemed as major and minor. Again, we will use a function in the <code>GoT</code> package.</p>

<div id="biases" class="section level2">
<h2>Biases</h2>
<p>There are some biases introduced that are immediatly obvious. First, we scrape the GoT scripts from <a href="www.genius.com">www.genius.com</a> and not every episode was annotated. Therefore, there are a few episodes that we will be missing in our analysis later. Most of season 2 and 3 were not available when I wrote this post. I’ll continually check if someone annotates and update this blog post and future analysis if they appear. Second, the content on this site is supplied by users and is not verified by HBO. The content does contain some typo’s and may not exactly match the true script. Third, the character vector scraped from <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/List_of_characters">“http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/List_of_characters”</a> is similarly a fan generated page and is susceptible to inaccurate information.</p>
</div>
<div id="future-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Future Work</h2>
<p>In my next blog post, I’ll be covering how to clean this data using <code>dplyr</code> and <code>tidyr</code> tools. While <code>geniusr</code> and my functions to scrape character data returned dataframes that are relatively clean, before I analyze I will need to extract more information and format the data more specifically.</p>
