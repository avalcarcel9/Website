I'm currently a fifth-year doctoral student studying Biostatistics in the [Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics](http://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania. I am an active researcher within the [PennSIVE Center](https://www.cceb.med.upenn.edu/pennsive) under the co-mentorship of [Russell [Taki] Shinohara](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8574254) and [Kristin Linn](www.kristinlinn.com). 

Primarily, my research interests lie in the development of statistical methods for analyzing neuroimaging data sets with the goal of understanding disease processes in the brain. Currently, my projects involve the analysis of multi-sequence structural MRI to study neurodevelopment and multiple sclerosis. I collaborate regularly with experts in bioengineering, radiology, and neurology. Beyond my statistical work in neuroimaging, I love building software tools that make data science better, faster, and more accessible.

I earned my M.S. in Biostatistics from University of Pennsylvania in 2017. My thesis proposed a novel machine learning algorithm, MIMoSA, to automatically detect T2 hyperintense white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis. Before coming to Penn, I obtained my undergraduate degree in Biology and Statistics (Honors) from University of Connecticut (Go Huskies).

Outside of biostatistics and data science, you can find me baby-sitting my nieces and nephew, at concerts, running, hiking, and traveling. I love wandering where the wifi is weak. Sometimes it is in-tents. 

The photo at the top of this page is from hiking in a cloud forest in Monteverde Costa Rica. Some of my favorite adventures are included below.

Not sure I understood the gravity of the whole sky diving thing.

While an undergraduate at the University of Connecticut, I studied abroad in Granada Spain. Queen Isabel said once, "Esta ciudad, que la tengo en mas que a mi vida," which roughly translated means that Granada as a city that she carries in more than just her life. I couldn't have said it better myself. This is a picture of me in front of La Alhambra, a palace built by the Moors and conquered by the Catholics.

I had the fortune of taking a class in Spanish culture during my study abroad experience where I got to visit lots of Spanish cities. This photo is from a hike in Ronda. It is my favorite hike of all time since it is not too main-stream.

I felt runderful after my friend Lori and I finished the Philadelphia Half Marathon this past year. Lori and I played travel soccer together and have been friends and workout buddies since we were 7 years old.

I tried to see the sunset in San Diego but then I got dusk in my eyes...

After the Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM)  in Vancouver Canada I decided to go out on a limb and branch out so I spent some time hiking through the Canadian rockies. This was a river running through Banff National Park.

I went to the 2019 Women's World Cup Championship match in Lyon France. The USWNT team made herstory defeating the Netherlands 2-1. Equal pay chants erupted in the stadium and were heard around the world. As a trailblazer in the sport Mia Hamm was my favorite player growing up. These days I find myself rooting for Julie Ertz. She is both creative and consistent on the field. These are two qualities I admire and try to incorporate into my own career.

If you couldn't tell from my captions, I also really love puns.
