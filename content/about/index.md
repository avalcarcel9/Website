I'm currently a fourth-year doctoral student studying Biostatistics in the [Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics](http://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania. I am an active researcher in the [PennSIVE](https://www.med.upenn.edu/pennsive/) working group under the mentorship of [Russell [Taki] Shinohara](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8574254). Primarily, my research interests lie in the development of statistical methods for analyzing neuroimaging data sets with the goal of understanding disease processes in the brain. Currently, my projects involve the analysis of multi-sequence structural MRI for the study of multiple sclerosis. I collaborate regularly with experts in bioengineering, radiology, and neurology. 

I earned my M.S. in Biostatistics from University of Pennsylvania in 2017. My thesis proposed a novel machine learning algorithm, MIMoSA, to automatically detect T2 hyperintense white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis. Before coming to Penn, I obtained my undergraduate degree in Biology and Statistics (Honors) from University of Connecticut.

Outside of biostatistics and data science, I love to wander where the wifi is weak. Sometimes it is in-tents. The photo at the top of this page is from hiking in a cloud forest in Monteverde Costa Rica. Some of my favorites adventures are included below.

Not sure I understood the gravity of the whole sky diving thing.

I tried to see the sunset in San Diego but then I got dusk in my eyes...

Throwback to my days studying abroad in Granada Spain. Though this was actually in Ronda, it is my favorite hike of all time since its not too main-stream.

If you couldn't tell from my captions, I also really love puns.
